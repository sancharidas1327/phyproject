Abstract


This report presents a comprehensive account of the development, implementation, and evaluation of a Quantum
Neural Network (QNN) alongside hybrid quantum-inspired neural models, with the primary objective of
accurately predicting the electronic bandgap of materials. The electronic bandgap is a fundamental property in
materials science, playing a crucial role in determining the electrical conductivity, optical properties, and overall
functionality of a material in applications such as semiconductors, photovoltaics, and electronic devices.
Accurately estimating this property is essential for the design and discovery of new materials with desirable
characteristics.
To address this challenge, the project explores both purely classical and quantum-enhanced computational
approaches. The Quantum Neural Network, inspired by the principles of quantum computing, utilizes quantum
circuits and variational algorithms to capture complex patterns and relationships in material properties. In
parallel, hybrid quantum-classical models are employed, integrating quantum computational elements within
conventional neural network frameworks. These hybrid models aim to combine the strengths of classical deep
learning with the potential advantages of quantum mechanics, such as increased expressivity and faster
convergence in training.
The models were trained and evaluated using synthetic datasets designed to simulate real-world physical
relationships observed in materials. These datasets allow for controlled experimentation and the ability to
systematically test the models' capabilities. Rigorous experimentation was conducted to compare the
performance of QNNs and hybrid models against traditional neural networks. Metrics such as prediction
accuracy, generalization ability, and computational efficiency were analyzed. Additionally, visualizations were
generated to provide intuitive insights into the models’ predictions and error distributions.
The results demonstrate the promise of quantum-inspired models in advancing predictive materials science,
potentially enabling more efficient discovery and design of next-generation materials.


Motivation



Accurate prediction of the electronic bandgap is a critical task in the field of materials science, particularly for
the discovery and design of advanced materials used in electronics, photovoltaics, and optoelectronic devices.
The bandgap determines a material's electrical conductivity and optical behaviour, influencing its suitability for
specific applications such as transistors, solar cells, and light-emitting diodes (LEDs). Traditionally,
computational methods like Density Functional Theory (DFT) have been employed to estimate the bandgap with
high precision. However, these methods are computationally expensive, especially when applied to large
datasets or high-throughput screening of potential materials.
In response to these limitations, recent advancements in quantum computing and machine learning have led to
the emergence of Quantum Machine Learning (QML) techniques. Among them, Quantum Neural Networks
(QNNs) have gained attention for their potential to model complex quantum systems more efficiently than
classical counterparts. QNNs leverage principles of quantum mechanics, such as superposition and
entanglement, to explore a larger solution space and represent intricate relationships in data more compactly.
This project is driven by the hypothesis that quantum-inspired neural architectures, including QNNs and hybrid
quantum-classical models, can outperform traditional machine learning techniques in materials informatics
tasks. By reducing computational costs while maintaining or improving prediction accuracy, these models have
the potential to accelerate the discovery of novel materials and enable breakthroughs in the design of future
electronic and optoelectronic technologies.
Introduction
The electronic bandgap is a fundamental property that plays a vital role in defining a material’s electrical
conductivity and optical behavior. It directly influences how a material interacts with light and electricity,
making it especially important for applications in semiconductors, photovoltaics, LEDs, and other electronic and
optoelectronic devices. Predicting bandgaps from basic material properties—such as atomic structure,
composition, and lattice parameters—is a challenging regression task due to the inherently complex and highly
nonlinear relationships between input features and bandgap values.
While classical machine learning models, including deep neural networks and ensemble techniques, have
achieved considerable success in bandgap prediction, they are often limited in capturing the deeper quantum
mechanical interactions that govern electronic properties. As a result, there is a growing interest in leveraging
quantum computing techniques to improve predictive performance. Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs), which
utilize the principles of quantum mechanics such as superposition, entanglement, and quantum gates, are
emerging as promising candidates for learning complex material-property relationships with higher
representational efficiency.
This project investigates the use of QNNs and hybrid quantum-classical neural network models for the task of
bandgap prediction. The objective is to evaluate whether these models can offer improvements over traditional
methods in terms of accuracy, generalization, and computational efficiency. Ultimately, this work aims to help
bridge the gap between the theoretical potential of quantum advantage and its practical application in
accelerating materials discovery and design.

Literature Survey


 Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs):Quantum Neural Networks are an emerging class of machine
learning models that exploit the principles of quantum mechanics—such as superposition, entanglement,
and quantum interference—to learn complex and high-dimensional data patterns. Unlike classical neural
networks, QNNs can theoretically explore a larger solution space and represent intricate correlations more
compactly due to their quantum nature. They have shown potential in both classification and regression
tasks, including applications in chemistry, finance, and materials science. However, the practical
implementation of QNNs is still in its early stages, primarily limited by the constraints of current quantum
hardware, such as qubit noise, decoherence, and limited scalability. Despite these challenges, simulations
and early prototypes indicate that QNNs could offer significant advantages in problems involving
quantum systems or data with inherent quantum characteristics.
 Bandgap Prediction with Machine Learning:Classical machine learning techniques have been widely
used for predicting the electronic bandgap of materials. Models such as Random Forests, Gradient
Boosted Trees, and Deep Neural Networks have been trained on datasets containing compositional,
structural, and electronic features of materials. These methods are capable of identifying nonlinear
relationships between input features and bandgap values and have enabled faster screening of potential
materials for electronic and optical applications.
 Hybrid Quantum-Classical Models:Hybrid models integrate quantum components—such as
parameterized quantum circuits—into classical neural networks. These architectures aim to capture
quantum-like interactions and correlations without the need for full quantum computation. They are
especially useful in the Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) era, where fully quantum models are
not yet practical. Hybrids serve as a bridge between classical and quantum computing, making them ideal
for current hardware and simulation environments.

Discussion


The results of this study clearly demonstrate that quantum-inspired hybrid architectures offer notable
improvements in predicting the electronic bandgap of materials when compared to both traditional classical
machine learning models and purely quantum neural network (QNN) approaches. These hybrid models leverage
the strengths of classical deep learning while incorporating quantum-inspired mechanisms such as entanglementlike feature interactions and interference-based transformations. This fusion allows the models to capture
intricate, nonlinear relationships in the data that are often challenging for purely classical models to represent.
Furthermore, the application of an ensemble strategy—where predictions from multiple hybrid models are
combined—contributes significantly to overall model robustness. By aggregating outputs from diverse learners,
the ensemble method effectively reduces prediction variance and enhances generalization performance across
unseen data.
A key factor in achieving high predictive accuracy lies in thoughtful feature engineering. The inclusion of
physically meaningful features, particularly those inspired by fundamental material science principles, greatly
aids the models in learning the underlying physics governing bandgap behavior. The enhanced hybrid model
architecture specifically benefits from quantum-inspired feature extraction layers and interference components,
which work together to process and transform input data in a way that mimics quantum dynamics. This leads to
a more expressive and powerful predictive model suited for complex scientific tasks.
In this project, a comprehensive set of neural network models—including Quantum Neural Networks (QNNs),
hybrid quantum-classical architectures, and quantum-inspired neural networks—were developed and rigorously
evaluated for the task of electronic bandgap prediction. These models were designed to capture the complex,
nonlinear dependencies inherent in materials data. The hybrid architectures, which integrated quantum-inspired
computational layers with classical deep learning components, showed particularly strong performance. Among
all the models tested, the enhanced hybrid models achieved the best results, demonstrating superior accuracy and
generalization capabilities. Specifically, these models reached a coefficient of determination (R²) of
approximately 0.94 and a mean absolute error (MAE) of less than 0.1 eV, indicating highly reliable predictions.
The study also emphasized the critical role of feature engineering in improving model performance. Physically
meaningful features, especially those derived from domain knowledge in materials science, contributed
significantly to the accuracy of predictions. In addition, ensemble learning techniques were employed to further
boost model robustness and reduce predictive variance. Advanced neural architectures, incorporating elements
like quantum-inspired interference and feature extraction layers, were shown to effectively model the complex
relationships between material properties and bandgap values. The results were supported by detailed
visualizations, offering intuitive insights into model behavior and predictive reliability.
Upon examining Graphs 1 and 2, it is evident that the dataset exhibits a strong concentration in the higher value
regions of bandgap and other associated physical properties. These visualizations indicate that a significant
portion of the data points lie toward the upper end of the scale, suggesting a trend or bias in the material
properties being analyzed. This observation is further reinforced by Graph 3, which provides a more
consolidated overview of the model’s predictions versus actual values. In this graph, a higher density of data
points—represented by dots—can be seen clustering in the upper value regions. Moreover, the fitted line in
Graph 3 intersects the greatest number of points within these high-value zones, which highlights the predictive
accuracy of the developed model.
The consistency between the observed data distribution and the model’s prediction pattern demonstrates the
robustness of the model, especially in scenarios involving materials with higher bandgap values. The dataset
employed for this analysis comprises elements that are among the most commonly found in nature, along with
their fundamental and derived physical properties. The outcomes of the model align well with the established
scientific data, thereby validating both the quality of the dataset and the effectiveness of the hybrid quantum
neural network model in accurately predicting material properties.


Conclusion

This project establishes the significant potential of quantum-inspired and hybrid neural network models for
accurate, efficient, and scalable electronic bandgap estimation. By integrating quantum computing principles—
such as interference, superposition, and entanglement-like correlations—within classical neural architectures, the
hybrid models demonstrate a powerful ability to capture complex, nonlinear patterns in materials data. Among
the models explored, the enhanced hybrid architecture stands out, achieving state-of-the-art performance on
carefully constructed synthetic datasets that emulate real-world physical relationships. This level of accuracy
highlights the model’s capability to generalize well and provide reliable predictions in materials science
applications.
The promising results suggest that as quantum hardware continues to evolve, particularly with the advancement
of Noisy Intermediate-Scale Quantum (NISQ) devices and beyond, even greater performance gains can be
expected. Quantum-native computations could offer more direct modeling of physical phenomena, further
enhancing model fidelity. Looking forward, future work will involve applying these models to real-world
experimental datasets to test their robustness in practical scenarios. Additional research directions include
exploring transfer learning approaches for improved adaptability across different material systems and
integrating actual quantum circuits into training pipelines as hardware accessibility improves.
